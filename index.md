#### Hi there, I'm Bingjian(Alex) Huang.

Currently I'm a senior student studying **Computer Science** at **Tsinghua University**, Beijing, China.

I have great interests in understanding how people interact with their daily-life devices.
And I am passionate about using my technical skills to improve the interaction process.
That's why I step into the field of Human-Computer Interaction(HCI), also known as Human-Centered Design(HCD).

since April, 2018, I have been doing HCI research in the HCI Group (Advisor: Prof. Yuanchun Shi, Prof. Chun Yu) at Tsinghua University. 
I finished three different research projects related to Virtual Reality(VR), Telepresence, Wearable devices, gesture design and so on.

In 2019 summer, I worked as a summer intern in Inteco Lab (Advisor: Prof. Mark W. Newman) at School of Information, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.
I collaborated with PhD candidate Xinghui Yan on a research project about low-burden in-situ self-reporting.

My research interests are: VR/AR, Privacy & Security, Wearable Computing, and Human-AI Interaction.
