#### Hi there, I'm Bingjian(Alex) Huang.

Currently I'm a junior student studying **Computer Science** at **Tsinghua University**, Beijing, China.

I have great interests in understanding how people interact with their daily-life devices.
And I am passionate about using my technical skills to improve the interaction process.
That's why I step into the field of Human-Computer Interaction(HCI), also known as Human-Centered Design(HCD).

I have been doing HCI research since April, 2018 when I joined the Key Laboratary of Pervasive Computing (Advisor: Prof. Yuanchun Shi, Prof. Chun Yu) at Tsinghua University. 
Since then, I have participated in three different research projects related to Virtual Reality(VR), Telepresence, Wearable devices, gesture design and so on.

In 2019 summer, I worked as a summer intern in Inteco Lab (Advisor: Prof. Mark W. Newman) at School of Information, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.
I collaborated with PhD candidate Xinghui Yan on a research project about low-burden in-situ self-reporting.
