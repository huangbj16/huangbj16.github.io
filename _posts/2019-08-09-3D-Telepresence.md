# 3D Telepresence Framework

### Basic Information

**Time**: April-September, 2018

**Team**: Yizheng Gu (1st year Ph.D. student), Bingjian Huang, and another 3 undergraduates.

**Project Contributions**: We built a 3D telepresence software framework supporting high-level co-presence. Based on commercial hardware (RealSense, PCs and HTC Vive), it allowed remote users to communicate and interact with each other in a virtual space that merges rooms of both sides.

**My Contributions**: (a) learned parallel programming language CUDA and used GPU to parallel the 3D rendering process, which lowered down system end-to-end delay; (b) participated in system evaluation, responsible for experiments of more than 20 user studies. (c) drafted a small part of the paper.

**Results**: paper submitted to CHI 2019, Not accepted.
