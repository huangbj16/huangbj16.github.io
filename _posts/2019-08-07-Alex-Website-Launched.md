Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

Special thanks to the introduction website of [Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/). I've gone through several tutorials of github pages and this tutorial is the best one I would recommend.
