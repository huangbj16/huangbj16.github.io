    <h3>Time</h3>
    <p>April-September, 2018</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Team</h3>
    <p>Yizheng Gu (1st year Ph.D. student), Bingjian Huang, and another 3 undergraduates.</p>

<div>
    <h3>Project Contributions</h3>
    <p>built a 3D telepresence software framework supporting high-level co-presence. Based on commercial hardware (RealSense, PCs and HTC Vive), it allowed remote users to communicate and interact with each other in a virtual space that merges rooms of both sides.</p>

<div><h3>My Contributions</h3>
    <p>(a) learned parallel programming language CUDA and used GPU to parallel the 3D rendering process, which lowered down system end-to-end delay; </p>
    <p>(b) participated in system evaluation, responsible for experiments of more than 20 user studies.</p>
    <p>(c) drafted a small part of the paper.</p>
