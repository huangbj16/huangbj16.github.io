        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hi there, I'm Bingjian (Alex) Huang</p>
        <p>
            Currently I'm a second-year Ph.D. student studying <em><b>Human-Computer Interaction</b></em> at <em><b>University of Toronto</b></em>
            My supervisor is <a href="https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~dwigdor/">Prof. Daniel Wigdor</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have broad interest in Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality, from 3D scene reconstruction and human motion tracking, to human perception and multi-sensory feedback systems.
            Currently I'm working on a hapitc VR project in which I plan to build a haptic suit that enables precise and high-resolution on-body haptic feedback. This involves knowledge from HCI, Electrical Engineering, Psychophysics, and NeuroScience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before that, I conducted research at <a href="http://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/">the Key Laboratary of Pervasive Computing</a> at Tsinghua University (April, 2018 to November, 2019).
            My advisors are <a href="http://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/lab/people/shiyc/">Prof. Yuanchun Shi</a> and <a href="http://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/lab/people/ChunYu/">Prof. Chun Yu</a>.
            I participated in two research projects related to Telepresence and Holoportation in Virtual Reality(VR) and dual-handed Gesture Design on smartwatch. Paper was published on IMWUT 2019.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Summer 2019, I worked as a summer intern in <a href="http://www.intecolab.com/">Inteco Lab</a> (Advisor: <a href="http://mwnewman.people.si.umich.edu/">Prof. Mark W. Newman</a>) at School of Information, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.
            I collaborated with PhD student Xinghui Yan on a research project about low-burden in-situ self-reporting tools. Paper was published on IMWUT 2020 and MobileHCI 2021.
