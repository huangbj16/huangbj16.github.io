        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hi there, I'm Bingjian (Alex) Huang</p>
        <p>Currently I'm a senior student studying <em><b>Computer Science and Technology</b></em> at <em><b>Tsinghua University</b></em>, Beijing, China.</p>
        <p>
            I have great interest in understanding human beings, especially human's interactions with "things". 
            I would like to know how people interact with their daily-life devices, what are the existing limits, and what we can do improve them.
            That's why I step into the field of Human-Computer Interaction(HCI), which is also called Human-Centered Design(HCD).
        </p>
        <p>
            I joined <a href="http://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/">the Key Laboratary of Pervasive Computing</a> at Tsinghua University in April, 2018. 
            My advisors are <a href="http://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/lab/people/shiyc/">Prof. Yuanchun Shi</a> and <a href="http://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/lab/people/ChunYu/">Prof. Chun Yu</a>.
            Since then, I have participated in two research projects related to Virtual Reality(VR), Telepresence, Wearable Devices, and Gesture Design.
        </p>
        <p>
            Last Summer (July--Septempber, 2019), I worked as a summer intern in <a href="http://www.intecolab.com/">Inteco Lab</a> (Advisor: <a href="http://mwnewman.people.si.umich.edu/">Prof. Mark W. Newman</a>) at School of Information, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.
            I collaborated with PhD student Xinghui Yan on a research project about low-burden in-situ self-reporting tools. Our paper was submitted to CHI' 2020.
