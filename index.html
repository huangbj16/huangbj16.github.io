        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hi there, I'm Bingjian(Alex) Huang</p>
        <p>Currently I'm a senior student studying <em>Computer Science</em> in <em>Tsinghua University, Beijing, China</em></p>
        <p>
            I have great interest in understanding human beings, especially human's interactions with "things". 
            I would like to know how people interact with their daily-life devices, what are the existing limits, and what we can do improve them.
            That's why I step into the field of Human-Computer Interaction(HCI), which is also called Human-Centered Design(HCD).
        </p>
        <p>
            I have been doing research in HCI since April, 2018 when I joined the Key Laboratary of Pervasive Computing (Advisor: Prof. Yuanchun Shi, Prof. Chun Yu) in Tsinghua University. 
            Since then, I have participated in three different research projects related to Virtual Reality(VR), Telepresence, Wearable devices, gesture design and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I am working as a summer intern in Inteco Lab (Advisor: Prof. Mark W. Newman) of School of Information, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.
            I am collaborating with PhD candidate Xinghui Yan towards the research project about low-burden in-situ self-reporting.
